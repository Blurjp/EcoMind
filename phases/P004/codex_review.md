Review the following design document for Phase 4: Monitoring, Alerting & Integration Testing.

Focus on:
1. Completeness: Are all monitoring components covered?
2. Feasibility: Can this be implemented in 2 weeks?
3. Testing: Is the testing strategy comprehensive?
4. Dependencies: Are dependencies correctly identified?
5. Acceptance criteria: Are they measurable and achievable?

Design document:

$(cat phases/P004/design.md)

Provide a structured review with:
- Overall assessment (APPROVED / NEEDS_REVISION)
- Strengths (3-5 bullets)
- Concerns (3-5 bullets)
- Recommendations (3-5 bullets)
- Risk assessment (High/Medium/Low)

# Phase 4: Monitoring, Alerting & Integration Testing

**Phase ID**: P004
**Duration**: 2 weeks (10 business days)
**Priority**: MEDIUM (PRODUCTION RECOMMENDED)
**Owner**: Backend + QA Teams
**Status**: Design Review
**Dependencies**: P001, P002, P003 (requires complete infrastructure)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and integration testing to ensure system reliability, performance, and early detection of issues in production.

**Problem Statement:**
- **No Prometheus metrics exported** (gateway/cmd/gateway/main.go:191 missing `/metrics` route)
- No distributed tracing (no OpenTelemetry integration)
- No error aggregation (no Sentry/Datadog)
- No integration tests for backend services

**Drafting structured review**
[2025-10-08T01:47:44] codex

**Overall Assessment** NEEDS_REVISION

**Strengths**
- Clear inventory of service-level and business metrics, which will guide instrumentation work (phases/P004/design.md:121).
- Stepwise implementation tasks with code snippets make it easy for teams to execute instrumentation quickly (phases/P004/design.md:201).
- Defined SLO/SLA table gives concrete targets for availability and latency once monitoring is in place (phases/P004/design.md:182).
- Example integration and synthetic checks demonstrate intended test coverage across key flows (phases/P004/design.md:552).

**Concerns**
- Observability stack calls for Jaeger, Sentry, and Loki, yet no implementation tasks, deliverables, or acceptance criteria address tracing, error aggregation, or log collection, leaving major gaps (phases/P004/design.md:95, phases/P004/design.md:195).
- Ten-day schedule already packed with instrumentation, dashboards, alerts, 15+ tests, and synthetic monitoring is unlikely to finish within two weeks, especially with coordination across Backend, QA, and DevOps (phases/P004/design.md:195, phases/P004/design.md:548, phases/P004/design.md:677).
- Proposed integration tests depend on real Kafka, external services, and fixed sleeps, which will be brittle and won’t achieve the stated 80% endpoint coverage (phases/P004/design.md:552).
- Dependency list only mentions P003, but plan requires PagerDuty keys, Slack webhooks, UptimeRobot/Pingdom accounts, CI secrets, and Helm-ready Prometheus/Grafana infrastructure, risking late blockage (phases/P004/design.md:507, phases/P004/design.md:677, phases/P004/design.md:776).
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria (e.g., 0 false positives per day, <5 min MTTD in staging) are not realistically measurable during this phase (phases/P004/design.md:762, phases/P004/design.md:794).

**Recommendations**
- Add concrete tasks, timelines, and acceptance criteria for Jaeger instrumentation, Sentry rollout, and Loki/log shipping to align with the stated architecture (phases/P004/design.md:95).
- Re-slice the schedule (or extend duration) to account for infrastructure provisioning, secret management, and cross-team coordination before committing to a two-week window (phases/P004/design.md:195).
- Redesign the testing strategy with deterministic fixtures/mocks, coverage goals per service, and automation for alert verification rather than manual sleeps (phases/P004/design.md:552).
- Expand the dependency section to capture required external services, credentials, and CI/CD updates so teams can unblock them early (phases/P004/design.md:507, phases/P004/design.md:677, phases/P004/design.md:776).
- Calibrate success metrics to ones demonstrable in staging (e.g., alert fire drills, synthetic check dashboards) instead of production-grade MTTD/false-positive targets (phases/P004/design.md:762).

**Risk Assessment** High
