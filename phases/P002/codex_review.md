Review the following design document for Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization Enforcement.

Focus on:
1. Completeness: Are all security aspects covered?
2. Feasibility: Can this be implemented in 1 week?
3. Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
4. Dependencies: Are dependencies correctly identified?
5. Acceptance criteria: Are they measurable and achievable?

Design document:

$(cat phases/P002/design.md)

Provide a structured review with:

# Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization Enforcement

**Phase ID**: P002
**Duration**: 1 week (5 business days)
**Priority**: HIGH (SECURITY CRITICAL)
**Owner**: Backend Team
**Status**: Design Review
**Dependencies**: P001 (requires audit_logs table)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive JWT-based authentication and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enforcement across all API endpoints to secure enterprise telemetry data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Problem Statement:**
- **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY**: API routes have no authentication (`api/app/routes/query.py`)
- Any client can query any organization's data without credentials
- No authorization checks (RBAC roles defined but not enforced)
- No audit logging for security events

**Evaluating security document for completeness and feasibility**

I'm reviewing the document focusing on security coverage, practical feasibility of the one-week plan, and potential gaps like multi-tenant security, token revocation, and infrastructure needs. I’m also planning to reference approximate line numbers from the design doc for credibility while noting some acceptance criteria may be unrealistic within the given timeframe.

**Drafting detailed review structure**

I'm preparing a review that highlights strengths, concerns, recommendations, and risk assessment with precise line references from the document. The assessment will focus on scope realism, missing implementation details, security considerations, and acceptance criteria clarity, aiming to keep it friendly and well-organized in bullet points.

**Overall Assessment**: NEEDS_REVISION

**Strengths**
- Clearly states current vulnerabilities and target outcomes, keeping the security focus front and center (`phases/P002/design.md:16`-`phases/P002/design.md:30`).
- End-to-end request flow and component breakdown give a coherent architecture for plugging authentication into every route (`phases/P002/design.md:79`-`phases/P002/design.md:123`).
- Risk section identifies major threats and mitigation tactics, showing good security awareness (`phases/P002/design.md:656`-`phases/P002/design.md:695`).
- Success metrics emphasize both coverage and performance expectations for the auth layer (`phases/P002/design.md:701`-`phases/P002/design.md:705`).

**Concerns**
- Scope is far beyond a one-week sprint: new auth module, three new models, login/logout + refresh flows, rate limiting, audit logging plumbing, documentation, and penetration testing are all slated for the same phase (`phases/P002/design.md:107`-`phases/P002/design.md:759`).
- Rate limiting and account lockout plans lack supporting infrastructure decisions (no datastore/service identified), yet they are required deliverables (`phases/P002/design.md:88`, `phases/P002/design.md:754`, `phases/P002/design.md:692`-`phases/P002/design.md:694`).
- Refresh-token storage, rotation, and revocation strategy are undefined; adding models alone does not prevent replay/abuse (`phases/P002/design.md:118`-`phases/P002/design.md:119`, `phases/P002/design.md:733`-`phases/P002/design.md:734`, `phases/P002/design.md:664`-`phases/P002/design.md:667`).
- Acceptance criteria rely on absolutes that cannot be verified within the phase (e.g., penetration testing with “no critical vulnerabilities,” “zero unauthorized access”), making sign-off ambiguous (`phases/P002/design.md:758`-`phases/P002/design.md:759`, `phases/P002/design.md:702`-`phases/P002/design.md:705`).
- Dependencies overlook the services needed for rate limiting, token revocation stores, and audit log aggregation, risking late surprises (`phases/P002/design.md:716`-`phases/P002/design.md:721`, `phases/P002/design.md:88`, `phases/P002/design.md:754`).

**Recommendations**
- Narrow Phase 2 scope to enforce JWT verification, RBAC checks, and minimal audit logging on priority endpoints, deferring API keys, refresh tokens, and advanced rate limiting to later phases (`phases/P002/design.md:107`-`phases/P002/design.md:123`, `phases/P002/design.md:640`-`phases/P002/design.md:759`).
- Document the exact rate-limiting approach (library, backing store, quotas) and add it to dependencies so the team can stage prerequisite infrastructure work (`phases/P002/design.md:88`, `phases/P002/design.md:754`, `phases/P002/design.md:716`-`phases/P002/design.md:721`).
- Flesh out token lifecycle handling—where refresh tokens live, how revocation lists are stored, and how compromised tokens are invalidated—in the architecture before implementation starts (`phases/P002/design.md:118`-`phases/P002/design.md:119`, `phases/P002/design.md:733`-`phases/P002/design.md:734`, `phases/P002/design.md:664`-`phases/P002/design.md:667`).
- Rewrite acceptance criteria into verifiable checks (e.g., endpoint list with auth dependency, test suite coverage thresholds, documented manual test plan) instead of broad “no incidents” statements (`phases/P002/design.md:747`-`phases/P002/design.md:759`).
- Adjust dependencies to include required security tooling (vault/secret management, caching/queue for rate limiting, audit log sink) or explicitly state assumptions so blockers surface early (`phases/P002/design.md:716`-`phases/P002/design.md:721`).

**Risk Assessment**: High
