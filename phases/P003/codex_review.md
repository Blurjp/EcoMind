## 1. Executive Summary

Implement production-ready Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform for AWS provisioning and Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment, enabling automated, repeatable, and scalable infrastructure management.

**Problem Statement:**
- **CRITICAL**: Empty `infra/terraform/` and `infra/helm/` directories
- Cannot deploy to production without automation
- Manual infrastructure setup is error-prone and not scalable
- No disaster recovery or multi-region support

**Evaluating architecture document completeness and feasibility**

I'm reviewing the truncated AWS infrastructure design doc to check for missing components, feasibility of the 2-week timeline, cost accuracy, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. I want to highlight gaps like missing IAM and secret management, question the realism of the timing and cost estimates, review dependencies across phases, and assess if acceptance criteria are measurable and achievable given the scope. I'll also organize strengths, concerns, and recommendations to produce a structured review.

**Reviewing implementation plan and deliverables**

I’m assessing the plan carefully, noting strengths like clear architecture details and identifying big concerns such as missing EKS provisioning despite references, unrealistic implementation timeline, absent remote state handling, and potential cost underestimations. I’m preparing structured bullets with line references to highlight gaps in Kubernetes/EKS, secret management, dependencies, and acceptance criteria measurability to provide a comprehensive, concise review for revision.
[2025-10-08T01:46:13] codex

Overall assessment: NEEDS_REVISION

**Strengths**
- Detailed target AWS/Kubernetes topology with module breakdown clarifies desired end state (`phases/P003/design.md:76-175`).
- Concrete week-by-week task list gives implementers a starting structure (`phases/P003/design.md:236-759`).
- CI/CD automation scope spelled out, including GitHub workflow triggers and secrets handling (`phases/P003/design.md:760-826`).
- Acceptance checklist aligns deliverables with documentation and operational readiness (`phases/P003/design.md:918-928`).

**Concerns**
- Kubernetes deliverable depends on an EKS control plane, but implementation focuses solely on ECS Fargate; no Terraform plan, module, or schedule exists for EKS cluster/node groups, making Helm deployments impossible as written (`phases/P003/design.md:91-175`, `phases/P003/design.md:533-759`).
- Two-week plan includes standing up multi-AZ networking, RDS, MSK/Redpanda, Redis, ECS services, full Helm charts, CI/CD, DR testing, and documentation—far beyond realistic throughput for one sprint (`phases/P003/design.md:236-759`, `phases/P003/design.md:918-928`).
- Cost model understates managed service pricing (e.g., multi-AZ RDS exceeds $70/month, MSK broker/storage charges typically higher, three NAT gateways ~>$150/month), and omits ECR, CloudWatch, S3, backup storage, data egress, certificate, and state-store costs, calling the <$500 target into question (`phases/P003/design.md:838-856`).
- Dependencies list ignores essentials such as container registry readiness, production DNS/ACM certificate ownership, IAM/security baselines, and AWS account guardrails, risking late blockers (`phases/P003/design.md:8`, `phases/P003/design.md:140-143`, `phases/P003/design.md:760-826`).
- Several acceptance criteria (zero-downtime deploy, rollback test, DR validation) require additional tooling/process not planned, making them unlikely to be met in this phase (`phases/P003/design.md:918-928`).

**Recommendations**
- Decide on ECS vs. EKS for Phase 3 and scope Terraform/Helm work accordingly; if Helm is mandatory, add EKS control plane/node groups, IRSA/IAM, and kubeconfig automation to the plan (`phases/P003/design.md:91-175`, `phases/P003/design.md:533-759`).
- Narrow the sprint objective to core infrastructure (networking, database/cache, one compute path, remote state) and push DR drills, cost-optimization experiments, and advanced deployment testing to subsequent phases (`phases/P003/design.md:236-759`, `phases/P003/design.md:918-928`).
- Recalculate monthly spend using current AWS pricing with specified instance sizes, storage, data transfer, and include ancillary services (ECR, CloudWatch, S3 backups, ACM, Route53, state storage) to validate the budget target (`phases/P003/design.md:838-856`).
- Expand dependencies to cover prerequisites like hardened AWS accounts, IAM roles/policies, secrets management strategy, artifact registry, TLS certificates, and secure network connectivity (`phases/P003/design.md:8`, `phases/P003/design.md:140-143`, `phases/P003/design.md:760-826`).
- Introduce Terraform remote state (S3+DynamoDB) and secret management tasks explicitly in the plan to de-risk later implementation (`phases/P003/design.md:882-888`, `phases/P003/design.md:236-759`).
