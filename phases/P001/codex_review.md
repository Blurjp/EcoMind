## 1. Executive Summary

Implement Alembic-based database migration infrastructure to enable versioned schema changes, rollback capability, and safe schema evolution across development, staging, and production environments.

**Problem Statement:**
- Current schema is manually managed via raw SQL in worker enrichment service
- No version control for schema changes
- No rollback mechanism for failed deployments
- Schema drift risk between environments
- Team collaboration issues (conflicting schema changes)

**Analyzing migration doc for gaps**

I'm carefully examining the migration plan document to evaluate its completeness and feasibility within a week. I'm identifying potential missing steps like environment-specific configs, secrets management, baseline stamping of existing DBs with Alembic, and risks around running migrations repeatedly in containers. I‚Äôm also considering verifying line references to support critique and checking if all relevant tables are covered, all while ensuring my review is structured and detailed.

**Composing detailed review and assessment**

I'm carefully evaluating the submission's completeness, noting missing details like the absence of a baseline plan for existing databases and security risks from hard-coded credentials. I‚Äôm organizing the review into strengths, concerns, and recommendations with line references, concluding a medium risk assessment and an overall NEEDS_REVISION decision.
[2025-10-08T01:44:17] codex

Overall assessment: NEEDS_REVISION
**Strengths**
- Current schema and index requirements are thoroughly captured, giving engineers a clear target for the baseline migration (phases/P001/design.md:107).
- Day-by-day implementation schedule provides helpful guidance on sequencing work across the week (phases/P001/design.md:346).
- Risk analysis highlights operational hazards and initial mitigations the team can build on (phases/P001/design.md:558).
- Success metrics set quantitative expectations for rollback, runtime, and data safety (phases/P001/design.md:595).

**Concerns**
- Plan lacks a baselining strategy (e.g., `alembic stamp`) for production databases, so running the ‚Äúinitial schema‚Äù migration will fail or drop live tables (phases/P001/design.md:366, phases/P001/design.md:647).
- `alembic.ini` hard-codes credentials and offers no environment-specific secret management guidance beyond an implicit override, creating compliance and operability gaps (phases/P001/design.md:239, phases/P001/design.md:301).
- `migrate.sh` assumes shell access to `psql` and `DB_*` variables but does not specify how containers/runtime supply them, risking brittle automation (phases/P001/design.md:400).
- Auto-running `alembic upgrade head` on every API container start can race across replicas, extend boot times, and couple deployment success to migration health (phases/P001/design.md:480).
- Acceptance criteria mix binary tasks (‚ÄúTeam trained‚Äù) with outcomes that need clearer measurement/verification steps, reducing testability (phases/P001/design.md:645).

**Recommendations**
- Add a baselining section covering `alembic stamp`, sequencing for existing data, and dry-run validation against production snapshots before enabling upgrades (phases/P001/design.md:366).
- Replace hard-coded URLs with environment placeholders and spell out secret management expectations for dev/staging/prod (phases/P001/design.md:239).
- Document runtime requirements for `migrate.sh` (psql availability, env vars, retries/timeouts) or refactor to reuse application settings to avoid drift (phases/P001/design.md:400).
- Shift automatic upgrades to a single-purpose job or migration service and gate API start-up on a migration status check instead of running migrations inline (phases/P001/design.md:480).
- Refine acceptance criteria so each item maps to an observable test (e.g., link to a training sign-off artifact, define CI migration smoke test) (phases/P001/design.md:645).
