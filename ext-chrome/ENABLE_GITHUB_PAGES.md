- Verify branch is `main` and folder is `/docs`
- Check deployment status: https://github.com/Blurjp/EcoMind/deployments

**If privacy policy doesn't load**:
- Verify files exist at: https://github.com/Blurjp/EcoMind/tree/main/docs
- Check that `privacy-policy.html` is in the docs folder
- Clear browser cache and try again
