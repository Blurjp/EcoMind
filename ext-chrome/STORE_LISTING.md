## FAQ (to include on support page)

**Q: Does Ecomind see my prompts or AI responses?**
A: No. We only collect metadata (timestamps, provider, model name, token counts). Your prompts and responses are never accessed, stored, or transmitted.

**Q: What is "local-only mode"?**
A: Local-only mode keeps all tracking data on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers. You have complete privacy and control.

**Q: How accurate are the environmental estimates?**
A: Estimates are based on industry research and published data center metrics. You can customize parameters (kWh per call, PUE, CO₂ factors) for your specific use case.

**Q: Can I track custom/internal API providers?**
A: Yes! Add custom domains in the options page to track any AI provider.

**Q: Why does Ecomind need "all_urls" permission?**
A: This allows monitoring of custom provider domains you configure. We only observe request metadata to track usage - never the content.

**Q: Is my data sold or shared?**
A: Never. We don't operate centralized servers. In local-only mode, data stays on your device. In telemetry mode, you control the backend.

**Q: How do I export my data?**
A: View metrics in the popup or options page. For raw data, use Chrome's developer tools to access `chrome.storage.local`.

**Q: Is Ecomind free?**
A: Yes, completely free and open source under the MIT license.
