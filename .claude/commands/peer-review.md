peer-review (EcoMind Edition)

ROLE
You are Claude Code, performing a second-opinion technical review of Codex‚Äôs primary review for the EcoMind project ‚Äî a privacy-first AI sustainability tracker that calculates carbon, water, and energy usage across LLM and API calls.

INPUT

Primary review path: ./codex_reviews/latest.md

Referenced patch (if any):

./codex_diffs/latest.patch or a timestamped variant under ./codex_diffs/

Context files may include:

Frontend: ./ext-chrome/src/

Backend / API: ./server/ or ./webapp/

Shared logic: ./common/metrics/, ./common/energy_calc/

STRICT REQUIREMENTS

Fair, objective, and verifiable. Be explicit about uncertainty.

Evidence-based critique ‚Äî include file:line references with ‚â§2-line code quotes.

Comprehensive Checklist:

‚úÖ Builds & lints (TypeScript, Python, manifest v3, CI)

‚öôÔ∏è Logic / invariants / edge cases (e.g., metric resets, API errors, offline mode)

‚ö° Performance & complexity (avoid redundant energy calculations, background task leaks)

üîí Security / input validation (API key privacy, local storage, permissions)

üîÅ API & backward compatibility (Chrome extension manifest, metric schema)

üß† Error handling / logging / telemetry (especially user privacy compliance)

üåç i18n / config / docs / deps (language strings, .env vars, dependencies)

If Codex‚Äôs review is weak, misleading, or harmful, state why and recommend rejection or revision clearly.

You may propose a single minimal unified diff (in diff syntax), but do not apply it.

Disk Persistence (Claude meta-review only) ‚Äî never write to ./codex_reviews/*:

REPORT FILES

Write meta-review to:

./codex_meta_reviews/claude/ror_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.md

Update symlink/copy: ./codex_meta_reviews/claude/latest.md

OPTIONAL PATCH FILES (if emitted)

Write to:

./codex_meta_reviews/claude/diffs/diff_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.patch

Update symlink/copy: ./codex_meta_reviews/claude/diffs/latest.patch

Timestamped files are append-only. Rotate latest.* safely (symlink preferred).
Always print absolute paths under the Artifacts section.

Never write or modify any files in ./codex_reviews/* to avoid recursive triggers.

Be concise and structured ‚Äî no hidden reasoning chain.

OUTPUT FORMAT

Summary
Brief statement of your findings and Codex‚Äôs review quality.

Evidence Review
File-line evidence and context for key agreements/disagreements.

Checklist Review
Table or list summarizing which areas are ‚úÖ OK, ‚ö†Ô∏è partial, ‚ùå weak.

Risks
Enumerate concrete risks (logic, security, perf, user data privacy, etc.).

Alternatives (optional)
If Codex missed better approaches, note them here.

Patch (optional unified diff in ```diff)

Tests
Show snippets or assertions that would fail before ‚Üí pass after.

Rollback Plan
How to revert or disable changes safely (especially in browser extension context).

Artifacts
Absolute paths of generated meta-review and patch files.

Verdict
APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES + a one-sentence rationale.
