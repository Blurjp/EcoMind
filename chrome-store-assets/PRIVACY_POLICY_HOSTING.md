# Privacy Policy Hosting Options

Chrome Web Store requires a publicly accessible privacy policy URL. You have several options:

## Option 1: Host on Your Website (Recommended)
Upload `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to your website:
- Convert to HTML
- Upload to: `https://yourdomain.com/privacy-policy`
- Use this URL in Chrome Web Store submission

## Option 2: Use Google Sites (Free)
1. Go to https://sites.google.com
2. Create new site
3. Add page titled "Privacy Policy"
4. Copy content from `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
5. Publish and get URL

## Option 3: Use Simple Hosting Services

**GitHub Pages** (if you want to use GitHub without making repo public):
1. Create separate public repo: `ecomind-privacy`
2. Add only `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` renamed to `index.md`
3. Enable GitHub Pages
4. URL: `https://yourusername.github.io/ecomind-privacy`

**Other free options:**
- **Notion**: Make page public, share link
- **Medium**: Publish as article
- **Google Docs**: Set to "Anyone with link can view"
- **Netlify**: Free static hosting

## Important Notes

- Privacy policy MUST be publicly accessible (no login required)
- URL must be HTTPS
- Content should match exactly what's in `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`
- Update the URL in these files after hosting:
  - `chrome-store-assets/STORE_LISTING.md`
  - Chrome Web Store submission form
