## Test Coverage

### HuggingFace Model Extraction Tests (8 test cases)

#### ✅ Passing Tests

1. **should extract full owner/model from HuggingFace URL**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
   - Expected: `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`
   - Result: ✅ PASS

2. **should extract owner/model with hyphens and underscores**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b`
   - Expected: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b`
   - Result: ✅ PASS

3. **should handle query parameters correctly**
   - URL: `https://huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large?query=test`
   - Expected: `facebook/bart-large` (query params stripped)
   - Result: ✅ PASS

4. **should handle trailing slashes**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/google/flan-t5-base/`
   - Expected: `google/flan-t5-base`
   - Result: ✅ PASS

5. **should extract model from body if URL has no model path**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/inference`
   - Body: `{"model": "my-custom-model"}`
   - Expected: `my-custom-model`
   - Result: ✅ PASS (fallback chain works)

6. **should fall back to huggingface-api for single-segment models**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2`
   - Expected: `huggingface-api` (single segment not matched)
   - Result: ✅ PASS

7. **should fall back to huggingface-api when no model in URL or body**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/health`
   - Expected: `huggingface-api`
   - Result: ✅ PASS

8. **should handle complex model names with versions**
   - URL: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`
   - Expected: `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`
   - Result: ✅ PASS

## Build Verification

```
vite v4.5.14 building for production...
✓ 10 modules transformed.
✓ built in 85ms
```

**Status**: ✅ Production build successful

---

## Implementation Details

### Regex Pattern Change

**Before**:
```typescript
const match = url.match(/\/models\/([^\/]+\/[^\/]+)/);
```

**After**:
```typescript
const match = url.match(/\/models\/([^\/]+\/[^\/\?]+)/);
```

**Key Improvement**: Second segment now stops at `?` to exclude query parameters.

### Test Coverage Breakdown

- **Positive Cases**: 5 tests verify correct owner/model extraction
- **Edge Cases**: 3 tests verify fallback behavior
- **Boundary Conditions**: Query params, trailing slashes, complex names
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensures single-segment models fall back correctly

## Summary

✅ All 8 HuggingFace-specific tests pass  
✅ All 67 total tests pass  
✅ Production build successful  
✅ No regressions introduced  
✅ Comprehensive edge case coverage

The fix correctly extracts full `owner/model` repo IDs from HuggingFace URLs while maintaining backward compatibility with fallback behavior.
