## 🔥 Top 5 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Implementation)

### 1. **P003: ECS vs EKS Architecture Decision** ⚠️
**Impact**: BLOCKING
- Design mentions both ECS and EKS but only implements ECS
- Helm charts require Kubernetes (EKS) but no EKS provisioning planned
- **Action**: DECIDE - ECS (faster) or EKS (Kubernetes required)
- **Owner**: DevOps Lead
- **Deadline**: Before P003 starts

### 2. **P002: Scope Reduction Required** ⚠️
**Impact**: HIGH
- Phase attempts: Auth module + 3 models + login/logout + refresh + rate limiting + audit + pentesting in 1 week
- **Action**: Remove refresh tokens, API keys, advanced rate limiting → defer to later phase
- **Timeline**: Extend to 2 weeks
- **Owner**: Backend Lead

### 3. **P001: Missing Database Baselining Strategy** ⚠️
**Impact**: HIGH (data loss risk)
- No `alembic stamp` procedure for existing production databases
- Running migrations on existing DBs will fail/drop tables
- **Action**: Add baselining section to design.md
- **Owner**: Database Lead
- **Deadline**: Before P001 implementation

### 4. **P003: Underestimated Costs** ⚠️
**Impact**: MEDIUM (budget overrun)
- Estimated $380/month, likely $600-800/month
- Missing: ECR, CloudWatch, S3, NAT gateway costs
- **Action**: Recalculate with full AWS pricing
- **Owner**: DevOps + Finance

### 5. **P004: Missing Observability Implementation** ⚠️
**Impact**: MEDIUM (monitoring gaps)
- Architecture mentions Jaeger, Sentry, Loki but no implementation tasks
- **Action**: Add concrete tasks for tracing/error aggregation/log collection
- **Timeline**: Extend to 2.5-3 weeks
- **Owner**: Backend + QA

## 📋 Phase-by-Phase Action Items

### P001: Database Migration Infrastructure

**Timeline**: 1 week → **1.5 weeks**

**Must Fix**:
- [ ] Add baselining strategy section (alembic stamp procedure)
- [ ] Replace hard-coded credentials with environment variables
- [ ] Document secret management approach (AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Refactor migrate.sh to separate migration job (not on container start)
- [ ] Make acceptance criteria measurable

**Files to Update**:
- `phases/P001/design.md` - Add sections on baselining, secrets
- `phases/P001/design.md:366, :647` - Baselining strategy
- `phases/P001/design.md:239, :301` - Secret management
- `phases/P001/design.md:400, :480` - Migration job approach

---

### P002: Authentication & Authorization

**Timeline**: 1 week → **2 weeks**

**Must Fix**:
- [ ] **SCOPE DOWN**: Remove refresh tokens → defer to Phase 2.5
- [ ] **SCOPE DOWN**: Remove API keys → defer to Phase 2.5
- [ ] **SCOPE DOWN**: Simplify rate limiting → defer advanced features
- [ ] Document rate limiting infrastructure (Redis required?)
- [ ] Define token revocation strategy
- [ ] Make acceptance criteria verifiable (remove "zero incidents")
- [ ] Add missing dependencies (vault, caching for rate limit)

**Core Scope (Keep)**:
- ✅ JWT verification
- ✅ RBAC enforcement on priority endpoints
- ✅ Basic audit logging
- ✅ Login/logout flows

**Deferred to Later**:
- ❌ Refresh token rotation
- ❌ API key management
- ❌ Advanced rate limiting
- ❌ Account lockout (move to Phase 2.5)

**Files to Update**:
- `phases/P002/design.md` - Revise scope, extend timeline
- `phases/P002/design.md:107-759` - Reduce deliverables
- `phases/P002/design.md:716-721` - Add dependencies

---

### P003: Infrastructure-as-Code

**Timeline**: 2 weeks → **3 weeks**

**Must Fix**:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Decide ECS vs EKS (recommend ECS for faster delivery)
- [ ] If ECS: Remove all Helm/Kubernetes references from design
- [ ] If EKS: Add EKS provisioning tasks (control plane, node groups, IRSA)
- [ ] Add Terraform remote state setup (S3 + DynamoDB)
- [ ] Add IAM baseline provisioning
- [ ] Add secret management infrastructure
- [ ] Recalculate costs with full AWS pricing
- [ ] Narrow acceptance criteria (remove DR drills → defer to Phase 3.5)

**Missing Components to Add**:
- [ ] Terraform remote state backend
- [ ] IAM roles and policies
- [ ] AWS Secrets Manager setup
- [ ] ECR repository provisioning
- [ ] ACM certificate provisioning
- [ ] Route53 DNS setup

**Files to Update**:
- `phases/P003/design.md` - Major architecture revision
- `phases/P003/design.md:91-175` - Choose ECS or EKS
- `phases/P003/design.md:838-856` - Cost recalculation
- `phases/P003/design.md:236-759` - Add missing tasks

---

### P004: Monitoring, Alerting & Integration Testing

**Timeline**: 2 weeks → **2.5 weeks**

**Must Fix**:
- [ ] Add Jaeger instrumentation tasks
- [ ] Add Sentry integration tasks
- [ ] Add Loki log collection tasks
- [ ] Redesign integration tests (use mocks, not real Kafka)
- [ ] Add external service dependencies (PagerDuty, Slack, UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Adjust success metrics to be measurable in phase timeframe
- [ ] Add infrastructure provisioning time to schedule

**Missing Implementation**:
- [ ] Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- [ ] Error aggregation (Sentry)
- [ ] Log aggregation (Loki)

**Files to Update**:
- `phases/P004/design.md` - Add observability stack tasks
- `phases/P004/design.md:95, :195` - Jaeger/Sentry/Loki implementation
- `phases/P004/design.md:552` - Redesign integration tests
- `phases/P004/design.md:507, :677, :776` - Add dependencies
