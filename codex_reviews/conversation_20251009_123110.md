**Assessing test badge addition**
[2025-10-09T16:31:37] codex

Status: REQUEST_CHANGES
Reasoning: The new badge asserts “tests passing” without linking to any CI job or confirming status, which is misleading documentation.

Concerns:
1. README.md:2 – Adds a “tests passing” badge that has no backing CI job or link, so it risks misrepresenting the actual state of the build/tests.

Recommendations:
- Either hook the badge to a real CI status endpoint (e.g., GitHub Actions badge) or remove the badge until such a pipeline exists.
